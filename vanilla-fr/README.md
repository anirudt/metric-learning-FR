## What?
This is a Face Recognition learning repo for research.

## TODO:
- Try using the PCA done by the Shogun implementation itself.
- Conduct parameter tuning.
- Modify the existing NN function to give a kNN, for better comparison.
- Mangle the data in the format required by the metric-learn module and feed it for results.
